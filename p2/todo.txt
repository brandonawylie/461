Seth:
-Clean up code--> relayExtend

Brandon:
-Failures in routes.js

Pair:
-Failure cases, check for robustness (routers failing doesn't make ours go down)

Failure cases:
1) Node goes down on our circuit (timeout on stuff going acros our circuit):
    1-Send circuit destroy
    2-Exit()
2) No routers found in registration:
    1-Exit() w/ log
3) On a socket to another tor router....socket.on('end')----similar to case 1?
    -Destroy that circuit?
    -Stop trying to write to that socket
    -Send end other direction?
    -Take it out of routingTable
    -Take it out of socketTable

PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS?
-Writing to server after it closes
-Debug problems loading some webpages -- facebook, twitter, youtube
