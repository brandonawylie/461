Seth:

    -Proxy
    -Routes.js
-Clean up code--> relayExtend

Brandon:

    -Proxy side
    -Routes.js

Pair:
-Helper functions for socket functionalitys
-Double check on routing table (This is required for other stuff to work)
-Clean up logging





PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS?
-->Events.  In relay extend can we overwrite the original events for on opened and on created?


Also:
-Check to see it works with other router (non self loops)
-Failure cases & timeouts
-Tunnel from browser
-HTTPS?


Robust shit:
-It can setup two circuits at the same time on the same socket (fuck this?)
